## Crypto Basics

## Vulnerability Description
This module exposes a range of insecure cryptographic practices commonly found in web applications. These include the use of reversible encoding methods (e.g., Base64 for authentication), weak or outdated hashing algorithms (e.g., MD5, SHA-1), insecure password storage (e.g., unsalted hashes), weak obfuscation techniques (e.g., XOR encoding), and the inclusion of sensitive secrets (e.g., encryption keys or passwords) directly within container images or codebases.

## 10. Post Quantum Cryptography
<img width="1013" alt="10" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/59640fe2-72bb-43e7-8257-8ea7aa6897dc" />

## Observed Behavior
- Base64-encoded credentials were trivially decoded, exposing usernames and passwords in HTTP Authorization headers.

- XOR-encoded passwords were easily reversed using freely available online tools.

- Plain and unsalted hashes were cracked using online hash databases like CrackStation, revealing the original plaintext passwords.

- Private RSA keys were used to derive public keys and generate digital signatures, showcasing improper key handling in exercises.

- Sensitive secrets (e.g., default_secret) were hardcoded into a Docker container image and used to decrypt messages with OpenSSL, highlighting the risk of secret exposure in containerized environments.

---

## Remediation Recommendation

- Avoid using encoding (e.g., Base64) for authentication or security; use proper encryption mechanisms with secure transport protocols (TLS).
- Use strong and modern hashing algorithms such as bcrypt, Argon2, or PBKDF2 for password storage with sufficient salting.
- Eliminate XOR or custom encoding schemes for securing secrets and use industry-standard encryption libraries and algorithms.
- Securely manage private keys and never expose them in client-side environments or publicly accessible repositories.
- Remove hardcoded secrets from container images and use secret management solutions (e.g., HashiCorp Vault, Docker Secrets, AWS Secrets Manager).
