# (A1) Broken Access Control

### Vulnerability Description
The application uses predictable session tokens (`hijack_cookie`), allowing attackers to brute-force valid session IDs. This enables unauthorized access to other usersâ€™ sessions. Poor randomness in token generation leads to session hijacking.


---


### Steps Taken

1. **Initial Observation**  
   Navigated to the "Hijack a Session" WebGoat module to understand the session-based access control issue.

2. **Captured Login Request** 
   login to capture a request for analyzing.

3. **Setup Request in Burp Suite**  
   Sent the intercepted request to Repeater, removed the hijack_cookie, and resent it to observe the behavior. A new cookie was issued by the server.

4. **Observed Cookie Pattern**  
   Repeated the login request multiple times. The hijack_cookie value was updated for each request and appeared sequential with slight variation. These values were saved for analysis.

5. **Identified Predictable Patterns**  
   Identified a predictable pattern in hijack_cookie values. While mostly sequential, some values were skipped, indicating possible valid sessions..

6. **Brute Force via Intruder**  
  sent a new request in Intruder using one of the skipped session cookies and brute-forced the timestamp portion to find a valid session.

7. **Successful Session Hijacking**  
   Identified a valid session token, leading to successful unauthorized access.

8. **Lesson Completion Confirmed**  
   WebGoat confirmed successful hijacking of a valid session.

### Observed Behavior
- WebGoat accepted hijack_cookie with predictable values.
- No rate-limiting or session protection mechanisms were in place.

---

### Risk Rating: **High**
Session hijacking compromises the confidentiality and integrity of user accounts. Exploiting this flaw allows full control over another user's authenticated session.

---

### Remediation Recommendation
- Implement strong, unpredictable session identifiers with high entropy.
- Set secure flags on cookies and apply rate-limiting on session-related endpoints.
- Regularly expire and regenerate session tokens on privilege changes or inactivity.
- Monitor for unusual session access patterns via SIEM/logging.
