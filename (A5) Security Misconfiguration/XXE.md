# OWASP WebGoat - A4: XML External Entities (XXE)


## a. Module Introduction
This lesson introduces XML External Entity (XXE) vulnerabilities, their abuse, and protection mechanisms. The goals are to understand XML structure, XML parser behavior, and how to exploit XXE.

## b. XML Entity Basics
Demonstrates how XML parsers resolve internal entities by replacing them with defined values, laying the groundwork for XXE exploitation.
![b](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/960f2cf2-430c-4722-a69b-db77b5ba33ff)  

Explains how XML input is parsed and shows how XXE vulnerabilities arise when external entities are processed, potentially allowing attackers to exfiltrate sensitive files or conduct internal network scans.

## d. External DTD Inclusion Example
Demonstrates how external DTDs and XML entities can be abused to perform XXE attacks, including accessing local files like /etc/passwd by referencing them through the SYSTEM identifier inside a crafted XML payload

Shows a successful XXE attack where an XML parser loads the contents of /etc/passwd using an external entity. The file content is injected into the XML response, illustrating how a vulnerable parser can leak local files.

## h. Successful XXE Exploit
This image introduces a practical assignment in which the user is prompted to exploit an XXE vulnerability by injecting a malicious payload into the comment field of a photo post, targeting file system disclosure

## i. Exploit Payload
 This image shows an initial attempt to exploit the XXE vulnerability by submitting a crafted XML payload through Burp Suite. However, the response indicates failure (lessonCompleted: false) and a feedback message saying the solution is not correct, meaning the payload did not successfully trigger the vulnerability.

## j. Flag Submission
This image shows the successful execution of an XXE attack using Burp Suite. A malicious XML payload was sent containing a DOCTYPE definition with an external entity referencing a file (e.g., /). The server responded with a success message (lessonCompleted: true) and confirmed completion of the XXE assignment, indicating the vulnerability was exploited correctly.

## Observed Behavior

- The application parses XML input including inline or external DTDs.
- Entities defined in XML are processed and expanded by the parser.
- The parser returns file contents from the local system, confirming that the system is vulnerable to classic XXE.
- Improper handling of DTDs and failure to restrict external entities causes sensitive data leakage.

## Vulnerability Description

**XML External Entity (XXE)** is a vulnerability that allows an attacker to interfere with an applicationâ€™s XML processing. It can lead to data exposure, internal file disclosure, server-side request forgery, or even code execution. The root cause is the insecure configuration of XML parsers which allow external entities to be defined and resolved.
