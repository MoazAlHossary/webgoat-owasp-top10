# webgoat-owasp-top10
Hands-on walkthrough of OWASP Top 10 vulnerabilities (A1–A10) using WebGoat

## Objective
The purpose of this project was to simulate and exploit common web application vulnerabilities based on the OWASP Top 10, using the intentionally vulnerable WebGoat platform.
The goal was to gain practical experience in web penetration testing by identifying, exploiting, and documenting vulnerabilities in a secure lab environment. This helped build a deep understanding of real-world attack vectors, mitigation techniques, and secure coding best practices.

### Skills Learned

- Practical understanding of OWASP Top 10 vulnerabilities (A1–A10).
- Web application reconnaissance and exploitation.
- Manual and automated attack techniques using Burp Suite, browser dev tools, and scripts.
- Vulnerability documentation, reporting, and remediation suggestion writing.
- Secure coding insights and defensive strategy evaluation.

### Tools Used

- Kali Linux
- Docker
- OWASP WebGoat
- BurpSuite
