# OWASP A3: Injection – SQL Injection (Advanced)

## Vulnerability Description

SQL injection remains one of the most dangerous web vulnerabilities due to its ability to affect confidentiality, integrity, and availability of backend systems. While input filtering can provide a first layer of defense, it is easily bypassed. The only reliable defense is to use **parameterized queries**, **stored procedures**, and to apply **input validation**.

## Screenshots
 
###  Immutable Queries  
![1](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/d8ada267-3587-4390-ba9d-29dfceca8594)  
Demonstrates how static queries and properly parameterized queries are resistant to injection.

### Stored Procedures   
![2](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/86c5ad30-0777-4e93-9037-fdcad8fe9974)  
Shows safe vs. unsafe stored procedures. Safe ones use parameters; unsafe ones concatenate SQL dynamically.
 
### Parameterized Queries – Java Snippet

Example of safe SQL usage with `PreparedStatement` and `setString()` in Java.

### Parameterized Queries – Java Example

Demonstrates secure query execution using `PreparedStatement` and result processing.

### Try It – Writing Safe Code  
![5](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/8ddd24c3-8506-4c1a-872c-82ab75a65002)  
Writing safe JDBC to retrieve user status using both `name` and `email` with bound variables.

### Try It – Writing Safe Code (From Scratch)
![6](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/61c9d6f6-ac7d-489b-b4ca-1b4e6c80f014)  
Build Java code using JDBC and prepared statements to safely fetch user data.

Code passes the test for SQLi protection.

### Parameterized Queries – .NET 
![7](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/50f18fa9-cbd2-4d1b-bfb2-8d5e985e45d8)  
Example of using `.Add()` to safely pass input to SQL queries via `SqlCommand` in .NET.

### Input Validation Required? 
![8](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/497aea0b-2ecb-4cf6-9d55-6334bab9c361)  
Clarifies why filtering alone is not sufficient, and input validation is still necessary even with prepared statements.

---

## Observed Behavior

- Unsafe input concatenation remains vulnerable despite basic filters (e.g., stripping spaces).
- Even non-dynamic parts like `ORDER BY` clauses can be exploited if not explicitly validated.
- Secure use of `PreparedStatement` and regex-based input validation in Java/.NET effectively blocks SQLi.

---

## Remediation

- Always use **prepared statements** instead of building SQL strings dynamically.
- Validate inputs **before** passing them to queries, using **whitelisting** patterns.
- Protect `ORDER BY`, `LIMIT`, or other expressions that cannot use bind variables.
- Use **least privilege** when connecting to the database.
- Employ stored procedures **without dynamic SQL** wherever possible.
